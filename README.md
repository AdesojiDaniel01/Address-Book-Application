Address Book Application is a simple database-driven Python application that allows users to manage their contacts. This project demonstrates the use of SQLite for data persistence, allowing users to store and manage contact information such as name, phone number, email, and address. The application supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations, providing a simple menu interface for interacting with the database.

The project uses the built-in sqlite3 module in Python to manage the database and its operations, making it a lightweight and portable solution for small contact management systems.
